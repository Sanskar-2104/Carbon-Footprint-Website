# üå± SustainaTrack - Carbon Emission Tracker and Calculator

## üìå Abstract

A carbon footprint represents the total amount of greenhouse gases‚Äîprimarily carbon dioxide‚Äîemitted as a result of individual human activities such as transportation, electricity usage, and consumption patterns. Daily choices significantly influence these emissions, and adopting sustainable alternatives can lead to meaningful reductions.

While climate awareness is increasing, most existing carbon footprint calculators are either overly complex or lack user engagement. This project presents a simplified, interactive solution: a quiz-based Carbon Emission Calculator and Tracker. Instead of lengthy forms, users answer straightforward questions about their lifestyle. The platform then estimates their emissions and displays the results through a clear, intuitive dashboard.

To promote long-term sustainable behavior, the system includes a point-based reward mechanism that motivates users to adopt eco-friendly habits over time. By combining ease of use, personalized insights, and gamified engagement, this project aims to make carbon footprint tracking more accessible, actionable, and impactful.

## üìñ Introduction
As environmental challenges grow more urgent, it has become increasingly clear that our everyday choices‚Äîhow we travel, consume energy, eat, and shop‚Äîcontribute significantly to climate change. However, understanding one's personal impact can be difficult due to the lack of accessible tools that simplify carbon footprint assessment.

This project addresses that gap by offering an interactive, quiz-based Carbon Footprint Calculator and Tracker. Designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, the platform allows individuals to assess their carbon emissions through simple questions related to their lifestyle. Unlike conventional calculators that are often technical and complex, this solution presents information through engaging visuals and personalized insights.

In addition to calculating emissions, the platform provides practical recommendations to reduce one's carbon footprint across key lifestyle areas. It also incorporates gamification through a point-based reward system that encourages consistent, eco-friendly behavior. The ultimate goal is to make sustainability an accessible habit by helping users make informed, conscious choices in their daily lives.

Looking ahead, the project envisions expanding with features like AI-driven suggestions and mobile app support to further enhance accessibility and promote environmental responsibility.
