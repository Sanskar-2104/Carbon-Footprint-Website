# Carbon Footprint Calculator

## Problem Statement

### Background
With increasing global concerns about climate change, individuals and organizations are becoming more aware of their carbon footprint. Everyday activities such as transportation, food consumption, energy usage, and shopping habits contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions. However, most people are unaware of how their choices impact the environment.

### Problem
There is a lack of accessible tools that provide users with a personalized assessment of their carbon emissions based on real-world data. Many existing calculators either lack accuracy, are too complex, or fail to provide actionable insights.

### Solution
This project aims to develop a **Carbon Footprint Calculator** that evaluates an individual's environmental impact based on their daily habits. Users will answer a set of structured questions related to:
- **Food Consumption** (meat, dairy, food waste)
- **Transportation** (flights, car usage, public transport)
- **Home Energy Usage** (renewable vs. fossil fuels, appliance consumption)
- **Shopping & Waste Management** (electronics disposal, clothing purchases)

Based on their responses, the tool will assign **carbon emission values (kg CO₂e/year)** and provide recommendations for reducing their footprint.

### Key Features
- **Interactive questionnaire** to assess user activities
- **Emission factor calculations** based on research-backed data
- **Personalized feedback and improvement suggestions**
- **Data visualization** to help users understand their impact

### Goal
The objective of this project is to encourage individuals to make informed choices by understanding their carbon footprint and taking actionable steps toward sustainability.# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
