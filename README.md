# üå± SustainaTrack - Carbon Emission Tracker and Calculator

## üìñ Introduction
Everyday choices‚Äîlike how we travel, eat, and use energy‚Äîcontribute to climate change, yet most people lack tools to understand their personal impact. This project introduces a simple, quiz-based Carbon Footprint Calculator that helps users track emissions, get personalized tips, and build sustainable habits through a gamified experience.

## üìå Problem Statement 
Despite growing awareness around climate change, most individuals lack simple and accessible tools to understand and manage their personal environmental impact. Existing carbon footprint calculators are often overly technical, lengthy, or unengaging, making them difficult for the average user to interact with regularly or meaningfully.

This complexity creates a gap between awareness and action, where users may know climate change is an issue but struggle to identify how their daily habits contribute to it or what steps they can take to improve. There is a clear need for a platform that simplifies carbon tracking, provides actionable insights, and motivates users to adopt sustainable practices through engaging features.

## ‚úÖ Solution Proposed
This project offers an interactive, user-friendly platform that calculates an individual's carbon footprint using a simple quiz-based approach. By replacing complex forms with lifestyle-related questions, it delivers accurate emission estimates in an engaging format. The system provides personalized suggestions to help users reduce their environmental impact and includes a point-based reward mechanism to encourage consistent, sustainable behavior. Designed with scalability in mind, the platform is accessible across devices and aims to make carbon tracking practical, informative, and habit-forming.
